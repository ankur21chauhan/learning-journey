# C++ Standalone Code Collection

This repository contains a collection of standalone C++ programs for quick reference, practice, and learning. Each file demonstrates a specific concept, algorithm, or feature of C++ in a self-contained manner.

## Contents
- **Basic Programs**: Hello World, input/output, variables, loops, conditionals
- **Functions & Recursion**: Function examples, recursion basics
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- **STL Usage**: Simple STL examples (vector, map, set, etc.)
- **Miscellaneous**: File handling, error handling, and more

## How to Use
- Browse the `.cpp` files for ready-to-run code samples.
- Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.
- Use these as templates or learning references for your own projects.

## Contribution
Feel free to add your own standalone C++ programs or suggest improvements!

Happy Coding! ðŸš€



# Important read carefully!!!
For C++ you can use this as the task.json to have a separate input and output console system and for visuals just make seperate input output text files and follow these steps after your 3 files are ready (input, output, main)
view-->editor layout-->split left.

For LINUX users only, for MAC and WINDOWS you can use GPT

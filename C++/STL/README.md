# C++ STL Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ STL (Standard Template Library) learning journey! ðŸš€

This repository contains my notes, code samples, and explanations as I explore and practice various STL containers and algorithms in C++.

## Contents
- **Vectors**: Basics, functions, iterators, and usage examples
- **Lists**: Doubly linked lists, operations, and differences from vectors
- **Pairs**: Usage and nesting
- **Basics**: Fundamental C++ concepts and STL introduction
- **Practice Codes**: Example programs and pattern problems

## How to Use
- Browse the folders and `.cpp` files for code examples and explanations.
- Check out the markdown files (like `3.1 Lists.md`) for detailed notes and clarifications.
- Run the code samples locally to see STL in action.

## Why STL?
- STL makes C++ programming faster, easier, and more efficient by providing ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.
- Learning STL is essential for competitive programming and real-world software development.

## My Progress
I am documenting my progress as I learn each STL component, with code and explanations for future reference and for anyone else learning C++ STL.

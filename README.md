# Learning Journey!

Welcome to my personal learning repository! This project documents my journey as I explore programming concepts, solve problems, and build mini-projects in C++ and Python.

## About
This repository contains:
- Practice code and exercises
- Mini-projects and experiments
- Learning notes and resources
- Pattern programs and standalone code samples

## Structure
- **C++/**: All C++ codes, STL, Arrays, Mathematics, Hashing, Strings, Recursion, patterns, and standalone programs
- **Python/**: Python scripts, practice problems, and learning notes
- **.vscode/**: VS Code workspace settings

## Highlights
- Well-organized folders for each language and topic
- Markdown files for explanations and extra notes
- Code samples for quick reference and learning
- Pattern programs for logic building and interview prep

## How to Use
- Browse the folders for code and notes
- Run any `.cpp` or `.py` file to see the output
- Use the README files in each section for more details

## Why this repo?
- To track my progress as I learn new programming concepts
- To help others with ready-to-use code samples and explanations
- To build a strong foundation in C++ STL and Python basics
